my notes folder, now public






# todo
figure out why it's not getting the .txt files as posts  
in \_config.yml, i add the folder to defaults  
in the jekyll-optional-front-matter plugin, i forked it and try to change it so that it accepts .txt files, in addition of markdown files  
...but it doesn't work :(  

clean up front matter in the \*-list files  
clean up the config file
